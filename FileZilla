Install Client + Server

In Server:
(Optional -> Disable Firewall)
  1. Start FileZilla Server
  2. Start Administrar FileZilla Server
  3. Connect To Server -> Host: localhost -> Port: (default) -> Password: (desired) -> Ok
  4. Server -> Configure -> FTP Server -> Add -> 127.0.0.1 -> Port: 21 -> Protocol: Default -> Apply
  5. Users -> Add -> (username) -> Virtual Path: / -> Native Path: C:\ -> Apply
  
In Client:
  1. Host: localhost (or IP)
  2. Username: user (or desired)
  3. Password: (desired)
  4. Port: 21
  5. Quickconnect
  6. Accept

If the ftp remote connection does not work. Try to add a new exception on the server firewall that allows connections in the port 21. 
If you're too impatient to start, you can just disable your server firewall and try to remote connect again, you'll get results after that.
